# metrics-for-home
Playing around with metrics collection - also contains a small node server that will receive metrics and relay to prometheus

The purpose was to play around with prometheus and grafana.

Then as a practical example, I implemented a small node-service that will allow you to label IoT devices such that they are
correctly labeled in prometheus.
